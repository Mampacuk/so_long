# so_long
...and thanks for all the fish!

School 42 project "so_long" implementation (bonuses included).
## Notes
* To create an animation, I used the `clock` function from the `<time.h>` library. Unfortunately, it's the only way of keeping track of time. You should be ready to negotiate about this with your evaluator.
## Known Issues
* When the player makes a move into a certain direction, double-pressing of a button that'd move the character into a different direction displaces the character.
* Internally, I confused the right and left keys. Thus the `ft_receiveinput()`s that control left/right buttons should be swapped and adjusted accordingly.
