# so_long
...and thanks for all the fish!

School 42 project "so_long" implementation (bonuses included).
## Notes
* To create an animation, I used the `clock()` function from the `<time.h>` library. Unfortunately, it's the only way of keeping track of time. You should be ready to negotiate about this with your evaluator.
